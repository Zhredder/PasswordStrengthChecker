                <p><Strong>History: </Strong>Quantum computing came as an idea from physicists exploring the combination of
                    quantum mechanics and information theory. The journey began from theory to tangibility, from early 1980 to the first quantum 
                    computer being built in 1998.

                   <br>
                   <p><Strong>Theory: </Strong>
                    At the heart of a quantum computer are qubits, which, unlike classical bits, can represent a 0, 1, or both 
                    simultaneously through quantum superposition. Entangled qubits can correlate in ways impossible for 
                    classical bits, leading to unparalleled computational power.

                   <br>
                   <p><Strong>Challenges: </Strong>
                   Quantum computers promise to tackle problems deemed too difficult for classical machines, such as factoring 
                   large numbers—an ability that could reshape cryptography—and simulating complex molecular interactions,
                    potentially revolutionizing drug discovery.

                   <br>
                   <p><Strong>Current Progress: </Strong>
                    Today, quantum computing is in its infant stage, with tech giants and startups alike racing to overcome 
                    engineering hurdles and demonstrate quantum advantage—where a quantum computer performs a specific task 
                    beyond the reach of classical supercomputers.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p><Strong>Challenges: </Strong>
                        Maintaining qubit stability, achieving fault-tolerant computing, and scaling up the number of qubits 
                        are among the significant hurdles that scientists and engineers are striving to overcome.

                    <p><Strong>Threats: </Strong>
                        The prospect of quantum computers breaking current encryption algorithms has spurred the development 
                        of quantum-resistant cryptography, ensuring that our digital infrastructure remains secure in the quantum age.
