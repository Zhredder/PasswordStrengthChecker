        <h3>Dear User, <br><br>

Technology has profoundly transformed our lives. From the discovery of fire by our ancestors over 800,000 years ago to the omnipresence of artificial 
intelligence in 2023, we have consistently pushed the boundaries of what's possible. <br><br>

As our society becomes increasingly connected and digitized, safeguarding our digital lives is imperative. Ethical standards vary, making it 
vital to take robust safety precautions. Understand that privacy — your control over personal information — and security — your defense against 
threats — are interconnected. Strengthening both is crucial. Today, we turn our attention to the critical role of strong passwords.  <br><br>

Passwords protect everything from social media to bank accounts. However, hackers employ various techniques to crack these safeguards. Brute 
forcing, where a machine systematically tries every possible combination, is a common method. Given the prevalence of simple, widely-used passwords, 
these attacks can be alarmingly effective. Managing complex, unique passwords for each account can be challenging; this is where a password manager 
comes in handy. Learn more about it here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w68BBPDAWr8  <br><br>

Speculations about quantum computing potentially breaking existing encryption paradigms led me to question the resilience of passwords against 
various machines. This application was born out of a desire to visualize these differences in real-time. Please note that the 'guesses per second' 
figures provided are approximations intended for illustrative purposes, based on a combination of general knowledge and estimation. They do not stem 
from empirical data or rigorous research. For a deeper understanding, please refer to the github repository  https://github.com/Zhredder/PasswordStrengthChecker  <br><br>

This project aims to provoke thought and encourage a proactive stance towards digital security. Progress is relentless; preparedness is key. 
The journey to secure digital practices is yours to embark upon.   <br><br>

Best of luck,  <br><br>
Shivam
